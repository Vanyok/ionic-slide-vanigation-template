# ionic-slide-vanigation-template
This is just IONIC template with back - forward page navigation

After my session during Ioniconf, there was a question about routing inside Ionic modals that came up during the Q&A. Because the modal is not part of your standard Angular routing, you need a different way to handle navigation inside an overlay that exists outside the rest of your application.

You can achieve the same navigation in all directions (forward, back, root) using the ion-nav component â€“ a highly underrated component that will rescue your day.
